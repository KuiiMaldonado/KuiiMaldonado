# Get to know me üßë‚Äçüíª

Hey there! My name is Cuitlahuac Maldonado. You pronounce it like this **[kwee-tlah-wak]**. Or if you prefer you can use my nickname, **Cui**.

It is true that I have a B.S. Mechatronics Engineering but during my last year during university I started working as a Software Engineer. That experience showed how much I love programming.

I like helping others understand stuff that they might find difficult. Also I'm always willing to learn and develop new skills.
